            Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and are currently the second most popular
            domestic pet in the United States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, care and diet can differ
            between breeds. However, some diets and practices are generally recommended for the well-being of your fluffy family
            member regardless of breed.

            It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is either pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her
            young if possible. Monitor your kittenâ€™s growth closely to make sure its growth rate is progressing steadily. If any
            kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate, a caretaker might need to feed the kitten directly either with a bottle or a
            feeding tube.
          </p>

            Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight appropriately include the following:

            Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically around three to four weeks after birth. According
            to the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/cat-care/cat-nutrition-tips" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASPCA</a>, kittens at this age should eat
            half to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day. If your kitten has difficulties 
            eating hard food, a small amount of water can be added to soften the food. Cat food that is optimized for kittens provides 
            the additional nutrients that are needed for growth, energy, and wellness. Depending on the breed, your cat may have 
            different dietary requirements. You should always consult with your veterinarian for recommendations.

          <p class="block">
            This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many nutrients. At this age, their level of activity
            decreases, and so does their metabolism. It is not recommended to leave food out for the cats all day. Instead, provide
            food a couple times a day so they eat meals rather than snacking throughout the day. This practice reduces the risk of
            obesity and other weight-related feline ailments.
          </p>
          <h2 class="block is-size-3" id="seven-years-and-more">Seven Years and More</h2>
          <p class="block">
            Much like many living organisms, the body begins to deteriorate and experience a lot of changes. Cats at this age should
            eat less fats and calories and more quality proteins. This means when you are purchasing packaged foods for your cat,
            look for food that states a particular protein (such as "salmon") and not just a category (such as fish). This usually
            means they are byproducts, or combinations, of lesser quality proteins.
