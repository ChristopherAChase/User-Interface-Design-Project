# User-Interface-Design-Project
This project is for my User Interface Design course through WGU. The project was based around the idea that we had a "client" that has a website for their business, but it's not very appealing, or user friendly, and doesn't meet a lot of the design standards. Our job was to take their current website, along with the user specifications document they provided and create a new, more user friendly, appealing, and SEO friendly website for them. 

## Tools Used
- To save time with styling, and making things a little more appealing from the get-go, I brought in the help of the Bulma CSS Framework. 
- Other than that, everything up to this point is straight HTML and Javascript. 

## Future Plans
I want to go back, and get rid of bulma, and go through the process of making the html as "scemantic" and accessibility friendly. I want to get rid of as many of the divs as possible, simply because I want to try and not rely so heavily on divs. But until the assignment is turned in, divs are fine by me!
